# Country Level Data of Cognitive Science Research

From time to time, I come accross an article, which compares some values accross countries (from personality, addition rates, gender differences,...). And from time to time, I want to test an idea that I have. And here country data can provide the first test of my intuition, expecially if I don't want to go collect my own data. 

So I decided, that when I come accross some research like that again, I will convert the tables into data, that I could use in the future.
